    intro:
      "Dark and dank! The Dungeon of abandoned dreams is not a merry place to be. Watered down soup and torture is on the day’s menu. Not for the weak. /nLike all others, you have been imprisoned without a trial, unjust and mistreated. The King weeds out the rotten fruits of society, his nephew, the court jester, you, all that don’t please him. You will perish in the dungeons like the filth you are.",
    description:
      "The Dungescape pamphlet adventure was born from two ideas. To write a small enough adventure to fit on two pages, and why not try to escape a dungeon instead of exploring it. /n/nThe original Dunescape was a three part adventure played at the Borås Game Convention 2019 using the Mörk Borg rules for the first time. But from there to here the idea grew beyond two pages and being a complete adventure. Now it's more like a start or middle of a larger adventure, or a very short one-shot. Or it might be used as a hook or a seed for a larger adventure or just a catalyst for your own ideas. However you decide to use it, just have fun with it. /n/nFuture Dungescapes will build on this theme and the next will be the continuation of this as we have played it. Enjoy!",
